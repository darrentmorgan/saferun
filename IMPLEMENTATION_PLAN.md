# RunSafe Implementation Plan

This document outlines the development stages for implementing the RunSafe GDPR compliance platform, following our established guidelines in CLAUDE.md.

## Stage 1: Core Gateway Infrastructure (Days 1-3)
**Goal**: Create functional API gateway that proxies requests to AI providers  
**Success Criteria**: 
- Gateway receives requests and forwards to OpenAI/Anthropic
- All requests/responses logged to console
- Health check endpoint functional
- Docker container builds and runs

**Tests**: 
- Unit: Request/response middleware
- Integration: End-to-end API proxy test
- E2E: n8n workflow calls gateway successfully

**GDPR Impact**: Foundation for all monitoring - no PII detection yet, just logging
**Status**: Complete ✅

---

## Stage 2: Database & Audit Infrastructure (Days 4-5)
**Goal**: Persistent audit logging with PostgreSQL backend  
**Success Criteria**:
- PostgreSQL schema for audit logs created
- Gateway writes all requests to database
- Immutable log entries with timestamps
- Database accessible via Docker network

**Tests**:
- Unit: Database connection and write operations
- Integration: Gateway → Database logging
- E2E: Audit logs viewable in database

**GDPR Impact**: Establishes audit trail foundation for Article 30 compliance
**Status**: Not Started

---

## Stage 3: PII Detection Engine (Days 6-8)
**Goal**: Real-time PII detection and classification  
**Success Criteria**:
- Detects EU passport numbers, IBANs, credit cards
- Classifies PII types according to GDPR categories
- Violation records stored in audit database
- Configurable detection rules via policy.json

**Tests**:
- Unit: PII detection regex patterns
- Integration: Gateway → PII Detector → Database
- E2E: Test data triggers correct violations

**GDPR Impact**: Core compliance feature - detects Article 9 special categories
**Status**: Not Started

---

## Stage 4: Dashboard Frontend (Days 9-11)
**Goal**: React dashboard for compliance monitoring  
**Success Criteria**:
- Real-time violation display
- Filter by date, type, workflow
- Export CSV reports
- Responsive Material-UI design

**Tests**:
- Unit: React component testing
- Integration: API → Dashboard data flow
- E2E: Complete user workflow testing

**GDPR Impact**: Provides transparency for compliance officers per Article 30
**Status**: Not Started

---

## Stage 5: Network Tap Monitor (Days 12-13)
**Goal**: Passive network traffic monitoring  
**Success Criteria**:
- Monitors container network traffic
- Detects data flows outside gateway
- Alerts on potential bypass attempts
- Minimal performance impact

**Tests**:
- Unit: Network packet analysis
- Integration: Tap → Database logging
- E2E: Detects and logs network activity

**GDPR Impact**: Ensures no data bypasses monitoring (security layer)
**Status**: Not Started

---

## Stage 6: Production Hardening (Days 14-15)
**Goal**: Production-ready deployment and security  
**Success Criteria**:
- Health checks for all services
- Resource limits and restart policies
- Security scan passes
- Performance <50ms latency

**Tests**:
- Unit: Health check endpoints
- Integration: Service resilience testing
- E2E: Full deployment on clean environment

**GDPR Impact**: Ensures reliable compliance monitoring in production
**Status**: Not Started

---

## GDPR Compliance Assessment

### Articles Addressed:
- **Article 5**: Data minimization (PII detection prevents over-collection)
- **Article 9**: Special categories (health, biometric data blocking)
- **Article 30**: Records of processing (comprehensive audit logs)
- **Article 32**: Security of processing (monitoring and encryption)

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Data Bypass Risk**: Network tap monitors traffic outside gateway
- **False Negative Risk**: Comprehensive regex patterns + manual review capability
- **Performance Risk**: <50ms latency requirement with monitoring
- **Compliance Gap Risk**: Immutable audit logs with cryptographic signing

### Testing Strategy:
```bash
# Test data patterns (anonymized)
EU_PASSPORT="A1234567"
IBAN="DE89370400440532013000" 
CREDIT_CARD="4532015112830366"
EMAIL="guest@hotel.com"
PHONE="+49 30 12345678"
```

## Development Principles

1. **Security-First**: Every stage includes GDPR compliance verification
2. **Monitoring-Only Initially**: No blocking until detection is proven accurate
3. **Iterative Testing**: Each stage includes EU data pattern testing
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment guides after each stage

## Next Actions

1. Begin Stage 1: Core Gateway Infrastructure
2. Set up development environment with Docker
3. Implement basic Express.js gateway skeleton
4. Test with sample n8n workflow integration

**Note**: This plan follows our CLAUDE.md guidelines for "Security-First Development" and "Iterative delivery over massive releases". Each stage delivers a working slice of functionality that can be tested and validated before proceeding.
